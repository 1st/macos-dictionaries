# macOS dictionaries

This is a set of dictionaries to translate words from one language to another. Files stored in the readable textual format.

Also this project contains **python** tool to create an dictionary file to use via **macOS Dictionary** app.

## How to use?

We have already prepared dictionaries, that you can download and start to use.

Go to Download section and download latest version of the dict of your choice.

Then, unzip the file and move contents to the `~/Libary/Dictionaries` folder.

Restart macOS Dictionary app. Go to Preferences section and activate your dictionary.

Now you can hard click on any word *(if you have Macbook with force touch)* or click two finders and select "Look Up" option in the context menu.

You are done!

## How to contribute?

If you found a problem *(some words are missing, some translatons are incorrect)* - then you can:
- open an issue, where describe what is wrong, or
- create a pull request. To do this, edit a text file to fix the problem, and then create a pull request. After review it will be applied (or rejected). Your changes will appear in new version of dictionaries on the regular basis *(dictionaries compiled periodically, to include last corrections)*.
